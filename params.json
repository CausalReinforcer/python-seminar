{"name":"Python Computing for Science ","google":"","tagline":"Undergraduate/Graduate Seminar Course at UC Berkeley (AY 250)","body":"##### Wheeler 221: Monday 2 - 5 PM FALL 2012 (CCN #060802) #####\r\n\r\n#### Synopsis ####\r\n\r\n[Python](http://python.org) is becoming the *de facto* [superglue language for modern scientific computing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/y9rku/astrophysicist_joshua_bloom_on_python_as_super/). In this course we will learn Pythonic interactions with databases, imaging processing, advanced statistical and numerical packages, web frameworks, machine-learning, and parallelism. Each week will involve lectures and coding projects. In the final project, students will build a working codebase useful for their own research domain.\r\n\r\nThis class is for any student working in a quantative discpline and with familiarily with Python. Those who completed the [Python Bootcamp](http://www.pythonbootcamp.info) or equivalent will be eligible. \r\n\r\n#### Course Schedule ####\r\n\r\nDate | Content | Leader\r\n:--- | --------| ---: |\r\nAug 27  | **Advanced Python Language Concepts** (geared towards Boot Camp graduates)\t| Josh\r\nSep 3\t| holiday\r\nSep 10  | **Advanced versioning, application building (optparse), debugging & testing**\t| Isaac\r\nSep 17  |(matplotlib) **Advanced plotting and data vizualization, mayavi**\t | Fernando \r\nSep 24\t| **scipy, numpy, stats**\t | Berian/Brad\r\nOct 1  | **scikits: image, learn**   | Josh/Joey\r\nOct 8  | **interacting with the world** (xml-rpc, urllib, sending and receiving email, serial)\t| Isaac\r\nOct 15\t| **database interaction, large datasets (HDF5)**\t| Josh\r\nOct 22\t| **GUI (Tkinter, GTK, Traits)**\t | Josh\r\nOct 29\t| **parallelization (ipython), cuda**\t|\tFernando/Paul\r\nNov 5\t| **web-frameworks (CGI), Flask/Bottle**\t| Josh\r\nNov 12  | holiday\r\nNov 19\t| **Symbolic, mathematical and Bayesian programming: simpy, sage, R, rpy2, pyMC/emc** | Berian/Joey\r\nNov 26\t| **Cython; wrapper around legacy code** -- FORTRAN, C, etc |\tErik\r\nOnward\t| final project work\t  |\r\n\r\n#### Workflow ####\r\n\r\nEach Monday we will be introducing a resonably self-contained topic with two back-to-back lectures. In between a short (~20 minute) breakout coding session will be conducted. Homeworks will require you to write a large (several hundred line) codebase.\r\n\r\n#### Contact ####\r\n\r\nEmail us at [ucbpythonclass@gmail.com](mailto:ucbpythonclass@gmail.com) or contact the professor directly ([jbloom@astro.berkeley.edu](jbloom@astro.berkeley.edu)). Auditing is not permitted by the University but those wishing to sit in on a class or two should contact the professor before attending.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
