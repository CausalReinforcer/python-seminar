Python Computing for Data Science
==============

#### An Undergraduate/Graduate Seminar Course at UC Berkeley (AY 250) ####

##### HFA B-1: Thursday 1 - 4 PM FALL 2013 (CCN #06080) #####

#### Synopsis ####

[Python](http://python.org) is becoming the *de facto* [superglue language for modern scientific computing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/y9rku/astrophysicist_joshua_bloom_on_python_as_super/). In this course we will learn Pythonic interactions with databases, imaging processing, advanced statistical and numerical packages, web frameworks, machine-learning, and parallelism. Each week will involve lectures and coding projects. In the final project, students will build a working codebase useful for their own research domain.

This class is for any student working in a quantative discpline and with familiarily with Python. Those who completed the [Python Bootcamp](http://www.pythonbootcamp.info) or equivalent will be eligible.

#### Workflow ####

Each Thursday we will be introducing a resonably self-contained topic with two back-to-back lectures. In between a short (~20 minute) breakout coding session will be conducted. Homeworks will require you to write a large (several hundred line) codebase.

There will be a regular help session every Monday morning before homeworks are due, 10am-12 in Evans 481.  Email [Josh](mailto:joshbloom@berkeley.edu) with any questions if you cannot attend.

#### Contact ####

Email us at [ucbpythonclass@gmail.com](mailto:ucbpythonclass@gmail.com) or contact the professor directly ([jbloom@astro.berkeley.edu](jbloom@astro.berkeley.edu)).  You can also contact the GSI, Adam, at ([amorgan@astro.berkeley.edu](amorgan@astro.berkeley.edu). Auditing is not permitted by the University but those wishing to sit in on a class or two should contact the professor before attending.
